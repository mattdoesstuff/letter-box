Built as an assignment for Advanced Programming at The Peddie School.

This python program prints solutions to a given NYT Letter Boxed game using a recursive algorithm.

The solver was built with focus on efficiency, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

A powerpoint presentation describing the program is located in the root of the repository.
